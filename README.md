## 🛡️ Privacy & Secure macOS Build (Isolated Build)

This version of oMLX is built with a **Privacy-First** philosophy. We believe that a local LLM server should be exactly that: local and private. To ensure the highest standards of security for the developer community and all users, we have implemented several critical safeguards against supply-chain attacks and unauthorized data flow.

### Privacy First
- **Zero Phoning Home:** All auto-update features are **disabled by default**. We believe you should have total control over when and how your software changes.
- **Diagnostic Transparency:** System-level diagnostic checks (like the StatusKit check for hidden menubar icons on macOS Tahoe) are **disabled by default**. oMLX will not probe or attempt to fix system settings without your explicit opt-in.
- **No Analytics:** No telemetry, no tracking, and no external pings. Your data never leaves your machine.
- **Respect for the User:** My intentions are to provide a tool that respects your digital sovereignty. This version is a commitment to the community that your privacy is not a "feature"—it is the foundation.

### No "Pre-chewed" Binaries
- **Double Check for the Community:** We do not provide pre-compiled DMG or binary files in this repository. This is not a "trust issue" vs the community, but rather a deliberate "double check" to ensure we respect and protect every user.
- **Verified Privacy:** oMLX is built from the ground up to respect your privacy. By requiring a build from source, we provide a transparent way for you to verify that the software behaves exactly as documented—your data never leaves your machine.
- **User Control:** You have complete control over the build chain. You know exactly what code is being compiled and executed on your machine, eliminating the risk of compromised upstream binaries and encouraging the use of our secure, audited build scripts.

### Security Features
- **Isolated Build (`build_tahoe.sh`):** Includes a dedicated build script for **macOS Tahoe (26.x)** that creates a temporary `.build_venv` virtual environment. This prevents host Python pollution and ensures a deterministic build.
- **Supply Chain Protection:** Automatically runs `pip-audit` to scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities. This protects against compromised Python packages (PyPI) before they ever reach your binary.
- **Reproducible & Secure:** Uses `venvstacks` with `exclude-newer` date-locking to freeze the dependency tree at a known-good state, shielding the project from malicious upstream updates.

### Build Instructions
1. **Requirements:** macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia/Tahoe), Apple Silicon (M1+), and Python 3.11 (recommended).
2. **Run the Secure Build:**
   ```bash
   ./build_tahoe.sh
   ```
3. **Output:** The final production-ready DMG will be located in `packaging/dist/`.

> *Every LLM server I tried made me choose between convenience and control. I wanted to pin everyday models in memory, auto-swap heavier ones on demand, set context limits - and manage it all from a menu bar.*
>
> *oMLX persists KV cache across a hot in-memory tier and cold SSD tier - even when context changes mid-conversation, all past context stays cached and reusable across requests, making local LLMs practical for real coding work with tools like Claude Code. That's why I built it.*

## Install

### macOS App (Build from Source)

For your security and total control over the build chain, **no pre-built binaries or DMG files are provided**. This ensures that you are running code you have audited and built yourself on your own hardware, protecting you from potential "pre-chewed" binary compromises.

To create the macOS app:
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run the secure build script:
    ```bash
    ./build_tahoe.sh
    ```
3.  The final production-ready DMG will be located in `packaging/dist/`. Drag the generated `oMLX.app` to your Applications folder.

Requires macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia), Python 3.11+ (recommended), and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4).

## Getting Started

### CLI / Homebrew

```bash
brew tap jundot/omlx https://github.com/jundot/omlx
brew install omlx
# Upgrade to the latest version
brew update && brew upgrade omlx

# Run as a background service (auto-restarts on crash)
omlx start

# Optional: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
/opt/homebrew/opt/omlx/libexec/bin/pip install mcp
```

Optional GLM-5.2 / MiniMax M3 native custom kernels currently require a HEAD build:

```bash
brew install jundot/omlx/omlx --HEAD --with-custom-kernel
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jundot/omlx.git
cd omlx
pip install -e .          # Core only
pip install -e ".[mcp]"   # With MCP (Model Context Protocol) support

# GLM-5.2 / MiniMax M3 / Qwen3.5 native custom kernels (strongly recommended
# if you serve those families -- see note below)
OMLX_WITH_CUSTOM_KERNEL=1 pip install -e .
```

Requires macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia), Python 3.11–3.13, and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4/M5).

> **Note on native custom kernels:** a plain `pip install -e .` does NOT build
> them, and the affected model families then silently fall back to much slower
> generic paths -- for GLM-5.2 the fused DSA prefill is roughly 30x faster with
> the kernels (measured 845 vs ~29 tok/s on an M3 Ultra), and the fallback also
> uses more memory (#2137). Building them requires the Metal toolchain, which
> Command Line Tools alone do not provide (`xcrun: error: unable to find utility
> "metal"`): install full Xcode, or use the official DMG which ships the kernels
> precompiled. Homebrew can build them with `brew install jundot/omlx/omlx --HEAD
> --with-custom-kernel`, but that build also needs full Xcode. To verify your
> install:
>
> ```bash
> python -c "from omlx.custom_kernels import native_kernel_status; print(native_kernel_status())"
> ```

### macOS App

Launch oMLX from your Applications folder. The Welcome screen guides you through three steps - model directory, server start, and first model download. That's it. To connect OpenClaw, OpenCode, Codex, Hermes Agent, or Copilot, see [Local Integration](#local-integration).

  <img src="docs/images/Screenshot 2026-02-10 at 00.34.30.png" alt="oMLX Menubar" width="240">
</p>

### CLI

If you want to use the CLI, the `omlx` command is available inside the application bundle or can be run from the repository after building.

```bash
# Example if running from source directory after build_tahoe.sh
./.build_venv/bin/omlx serve --model-dir ~/models
```
## Features

Supports text LLMs, vision-language models (VLM), OCR models, embeddings, and rerankers on Apple Silicon.

### Admin Dashboard

Web UI at `/admin` for real-time monitoring, model management, chat, benchmark, and per-model settings. Supports English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, French, Russian, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. All CDN dependencies are vendored for fully offline operation.

</p>

### Experimental Multi-Mac Inference

Source builds can split one downloaded language model across unequal-memory Macs
using MLX pipeline ranks over Ring or Thunderbolt RDMA/JACCL. The Cluster
dashboard handles read-only peer discovery, strict SSH/runtime verification,
byte-aware unequal shard planning, measured compute/link rebalancing,
headroom-aware execution tuning, activation, and a live shard/performance map
on both Macs. Interactive, balanced, and throughput profiles expose coalesced
batching, prompt-cache affinity, rotating-KV limits, Ring connection tuning,
and a capability-gated experimental token-only output path. See
[Distributed inference across Macs](docs/distributed-cluster.md) for setup,
security boundaries, current limitations, and the physical-hardware validation
checklist.

### Vision-Language Models

Run VLMs with the same continuous batching and tiered KV cache stack as text LLMs. Supports multi-image chat, base64/URL/file image inputs, and tool calling with vision context. OCR models (DeepSeek-OCR, DOTS-OCR, GLM-OCR) are auto-detected with optimized prompts.

### Tiered KV Cache (Hot + Cold)

Block-based KV cache management inspired by vLLM, with prefix sharing and Copy-on-Write. The cache operates across two tiers:

- **Hot tier (RAM)**: Frequently accessed blocks stay in memory for fast access.
- **Cold tier (SSD)**: When the hot cache fills up, blocks are offloaded to SSD in safetensors format. On the next request with a matching prefix, they're restored from disk instead of recomputed from scratch - even after a server restart.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/omlx_hot_cold_cache.png" alt="oMLX Hot & Cold Cache" width="720">
</p>

### Continuous Batching

Handles concurrent requests through mlx-lm's BatchGenerator. Max concurrent requests is configurable via CLI or admin panel.

### Claude Code Optimization

Context scaling support for running smaller context models with Claude Code. Scales reported token counts so that auto-compact triggers at the right timing, and SSE keep-alive prevents read timeouts during long prefill.

### Multi-Model Serving

Load LLMs, VLMs, embedding models, and rerankers within the same server. Models are managed through a combination of automatic and manual controls:

- **LRU eviction**: Least-recently-used models are evicted automatically when memory runs low.
- **Manual load/unload**: Interactive status badges in the admin panel let you load or unload models on demand.
- **Model pinning**: Pin frequently used models to keep them always loaded.
- **Per-model TTL**: Set an idle timeout per model to auto-unload after a period of inactivity.
- **Process memory enforcement**: Total memory limit (default: system RAM - 8GB) prevents system-wide OOM.

### Per-Model Settings

Configure sampling parameters, chat template kwargs, TTL, model alias, model type override, and more per model directly from the admin panel. Changes apply immediately without server restart.

- **Model alias**: set a custom API-visible name. `/v1/models` returns the alias, and requests accept both the alias and directory name.
- **Model type override**: manually set a model as LLM or VLM regardless of auto-detection.
- **Profiles**: save named bundles of per-model settings and switch between them from the admin panel. A profile can optionally be exposed as its own model: `/v1/models` then also lists `<model>:<profile>` (e.g. `qwen3-8b:thinking`), which serves on the same engine as the base model with the profile's settings overlaid per request — no extra memory, no reload. When the base model has an alias, the exposed ID is advertised as `<alias>:<profile>`; the directory-name form keeps working, just like for the base model.

</p>

### Built-in Chat

Chat directly with any loaded model from the admin panel. Supports conversation history, model switching, dark mode, reasoning model output, and image upload for VLM/OCR models.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/ScreenShot_2026-03-14_104350_610.png" alt="oMLX Chat" width="720">
</p>


### Model Downloader

Search and download MLX models from HuggingFace directly in the admin dashboard. Browse model cards, check file sizes, and download with one click.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/downloader_omlx.png" alt="oMLX Model Downloader" width="720">
</p>

### Local Integration

Set up OpenClaw, OpenCode, Codex, Hermes Agent, Copilot, and Pi directly from the admin dashboard with a single click. No manual config editing required.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/omlx_integrations.png" alt="oMLX Integrations" width="720">
</p>

### Internal Benchmarking

One-click benchmarking from the admin panel. Measures prefill (PP) and text generation (TG) tokens per second, with partial prefix cache hit testing for realistic performance numbers.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/benchmark_omlx.png" alt="oMLX Benchmark Tool" width="720">
</p>

### macOS Menubar App

Native Swift / SwiftUI menubar app (not Electron). Start, stop, and monitor the server without opening a terminal. Includes persistent serving stats (survives restarts), auto-restart on crash, and a privacy-respecting **optional** Sparkle-driven update check (disabled by default).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/Screenshot 2026-02-10 at 00.51.54.png" alt="oMLX Menubar Stats" width="400">
</p>

### API Compatibility

Drop-in replacement for OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. Supports streaming usage stats (`stream_options.include_usage`), Anthropic adaptive thinking, and vision inputs (base64, URL).

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Chat completions (streaming) |
| `POST /v1/completions` | Text completions (streaming) |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | Text embeddings |
| `POST /v1/rerank` | Document reranking |
| `GET /v1/models` | List available models |

### Tool Calling & Structured Output

Supports all function calling formats available in mlx-lm, JSON schema validation, and MCP tool integration. Tool calling requires the model's chat template to support the `tools` parameter. The following model families are auto-detected via mlx-lm's built-in tool parsers:

| Model Family | Format |
|---|---|
| Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc. | JSON `<tool_call>` |
| Qwen3.5 Series | XML `<function=...>` |
| Gemma | `<start_function_call>` |
| GLM (4.7, 5) | `<arg_key>/<arg_value>` XML |
| MiniMax | Namespaced `<minimax:tool_call>` |
| Mistral | `[TOOL_CALLS]` |
| Kimi K2 | `<\|tool_calls_section_begin\|>` |
| Longcat | `<longcat_tool_call>` |

Models not listed above may still work if their chat template accepts `tools` and their output uses a recognized `<tool_call>` XML format. For tool-enabled streaming, assistant text is emitted incrementally while known tool-call control markup is suppressed from visible content; structured tool calls are emitted after parsing the completed turn.

## Models

Point `--model-dir` at a directory containing MLX-format model subdirectories. Two-level organization folders (e.g., `mlx-community/model-name/`) are also supported.

```
~/models/
├── Step-3.5-Flash-8bit/
├── Qwen3-Coder-Next-8bit/
├── gpt-oss-120b-MXFP4-Q8/
├── Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-4bit/
└── bge-m3/
```

Models are auto-detected by type. You can also download models directly from the admin dashboard.

| Type | Models |
|------|--------|
| LLM | Any model supported by [mlx-lm](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) |
| VLM | Qwen3.5 Series, GLM-4V, Pixtral, and other [mlx-vlm](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm) models |
| OCR | DeepSeek-OCR, DOTS-OCR, GLM-OCR |
| Embedding | BERT, BGE-M3, ModernBERT |
| Reranker | ModernBERT, XLM-RoBERTa |

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Managed background server (macOS app or Homebrew install)
omlx start
omlx stop
omlx restart

# Start with default settings (memory guard tier = balanced, manage via admin UI)
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models

# Choose a memory guard tier at startup
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --memory-guard safe

# Set a custom memory guard ceiling in GB
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --memory-guard-gb 48

# Enable SSD cache for KV blocks
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --paged-ssd-cache-dir ~/.omlx/cache

# Set in-memory hot cache size
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --hot-cache-max-size 20%

# Adjust max concurrent requests (default: 8)
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --max-concurrent-requests 16

# With MCP tools
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --mcp-config mcp.json

# HuggingFace mirror endpoint (for restricted regions)
omlx serve --model-dir ~/models --hf-endpoint https://hf-mirror.com

## Development

### CLI Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jundot/omlx.git
cd omlx
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### macOS App

The native SwiftUI app lives at `apps/omlx-mac/`. Requires Xcode 26.5+ and Python 3.11+. venvstacks is declared as a dev dependency so `pip install -e ".[dev]"` (or `uv sync --dev`) brings the pinned version in. The build script also falls back to `uvx venvstacks` or `pipx run venvstacks` if you prefer a host-global tool runner.

```bash
# Stage a runnable oMLX.app (xcodebuild + venvstacks Python layers + ad-hoc sign)
apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/build.sh release

# Result lands at apps/omlx-mac/build/Stage/oMLX.app
open apps/omlx-mac/build/Stage/oMLX.app

# Force a fresh venvstacks rebuild (otherwise it's cached by fingerprint)
apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/build.sh release --rebuild-donor

# Stage with optional GLM-5.2 / MiniMax M3 native custom kernels
apps/omlx-mac/Scripts/build.sh release --with-custom-kernel
```

First cold build takes 10–20 minutes (venvstacks Python layer assembly). Subsequent builds reuse the cached `packaging/_export/` and finish in about 4 minutes. See [packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md) for the layer configuration and [apps/omlx-mac/](apps/omlx-mac/) for the Swift sources.
