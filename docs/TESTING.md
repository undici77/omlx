# QSA reservation tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_qwen4_qsa_reservation_integration.py tests/test_qwen4_qsa_reserved_capacity.py` to check QSA capacity reservations.

The integration tests cover restored-prefix lengths with boundary snapshots enabled and disabled, the first allocation after cache restoration, and prefill/decode output equivalence using a small Qwen4 model.

Related regression suites are `test_qwen4_qsa_incremental_cache.py`, `test_qwen4_qsa_decode_gather.py`, and `test_prefill_oom_graceful.py`.

# Prefill memory accounting tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_prefill_transient_tracker.py tests/test_prefill_oom_graceful.py` to check retained versus reclaimed overhead, configured chunk sizes, and abort-cap enforcement. The loop tests run a small initialized MLX model with controlled footprint readings through external and chunked prefill; they do not load a checkpoint.

# Prefix cache completion tests

Run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_scheduler.py tests/test_scheduler_boundary_completion.py tests/test_prefix_cache_gdn_split.py` to check cache-freshness admission and completed boundary recovery. The completion tests use a small initialized Qwen3.5 hybrid model and the real BatchGenerator, then compare restored-prefix logits with a fresh forward pass. They cover embedded snapshots, GDN sidecars, off-boundary completion, and unknown or inconsistent cache positions.
