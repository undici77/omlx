"""Fused routed and shared experts for one-token Qwen3.5-MoE-family decode.

After the fused router, a one-token MoE block runs its routed experts as the
gate+up ``gather_qmm``, the compiled SwiGLU and the down ``gather_qmm`` (each
``gather_qmm`` behind an ``arange`` for its row indices), the shared expert
as three ``quantized_matmul`` launches and a SwiGLU, the shared-expert gate
as one more ``quantized_matmul``, and one combine launch for the
score-weighted sum plus the gated shared expert. At batch-one decode these
launches are short and mostly depend on each other, so this patch runs the
same arithmetic in two launches after the router:

1. gate+up with a SwiGLU epilogue, for the selected experts and the
   shared expert, plus the shared-expert gate row. Each simdgroup computes
   the gate rows and the matching up rows of one expert with MLX's
   ``qmv_fast`` lane partition and add order, rounds both to the activation
   dtype, then applies MLX's ``Sigmoid`` and the two multiplies of the
   compiled ``swiglu`` in its order. The gate row follows MLX's ``qmv`` for
   a one-row output; its threadgroup comes first in the grid, so its long
   serial K walk overlaps the expert rows.
2. down with the combine. Simdgroup ``j`` of a threadgroup runs the stock
   ``qmv_fast`` or ``qmv`` work of selected expert ``j`` for
   the threadgroup's rows, one more simdgroup the shared expert's. Each row
   is rounded, then the combine of ``qwen35_moe_router.fused_moe_combine``
   follows: score products summed in MLX's ``col_reduce_small`` order, plus
   ``sigmoid(shared_gate) * shared``.

The router ahead of them (gate linear, precise softmax, fused top-k) runs
the gate linear as MLX's one-row gemv spread over one simdgroup per expert
(``qwen35_moe_router.router_gemv``; MLX's own launch has 32 threadgroups).
Its softmax and top-k run inside the gate+up launch where the shapes allow
(``qwen35_moe_router.softmax_topk_eligible``): the launch's first block
stores the row's selection and scores for the down launch, and every
simdgroup of an expert block recomputes the selection it serves from the
router logits with ``softmax_topk_row``'s arithmetic, so the block is three
dependent launches instead of four. ``OMLX_QWEN35_MOE_TOPK_FOLD=0`` runs
the softmax and top-k as their own launch
(``qwen35_moe_router.softmax_topk_row``).

The result is bit-identical to the composed path. The quantized dot products
reuse the MLX 0.32.2 transcription in ``moe_verify_gather`` (4, 5, 6 and
8 bits; group size 32, 64 or 128), one instantiation per weight format. MLX
picks ``qmv_fast`` when N % 8 == 0 and K is a multiple of its kernel block
(512 for 4/5-bit, 256 for 6/8-bit weights) and ``qmv`` otherwise.
Routed experts are taken where gate+up takes ``qmv_fast``: one bf16 or fp16
token, top-k 8 or 10, affine experts with scales in the activation dtype
(Qwen3.5/3.6-35B-A3B: hidden 2048, intermediate 512; Qwen3.8-Flash-Next: 2560
and 640). Down takes ``qmv_fast`` or ``qmv``. A shared expert or gate outside
that format (unquantized, packed, ...) runs as composed launches and only its outputs
enter the combine. Prefill, multi-row calls and every other shape keep the
original body. If the first launch fails, the patch disables itself and the
block keeps its composed body. ``OMLX_QWEN35_MOE_ROUTED_DECODE=0`` keeps the
composed body; ``OMLX_QWEN35_MOE_SHARED_FOLD=0`` keeps the shared expert and
its gate as composed launches.

Row-exact MTP verify windows (1..8 rows whose logits must equal serial
decode) run the same arithmetic for the whole window in the same launches:
the router gemv over all rows (``qwen35_moe_router.router_gemv``), then
window variants of the launches above in which each threadgroup serves one
row with the one-token source verbatim (threadgroups of one weight block for
consecutive rows are adjacent, so shared experts are fetched once through
the cache). Up to three rows select inside the gate+up launch; from four
rows on the recomputed selections cost more than the routing launch
(``softmax_topk_rows``) they save, so it runs on its own. Every row is
bit-identical to the fused one-token call on that row. This replaces the
verifier's composed MoE (about fifteen launches, two of them binding the
whole stacked experts) only while row-exact verify is armed and the block
folds its shared expert; one-row windows run the one-token launches. If the
first window launch fails, the verifier keeps its composed MoE.
``OMLX_QWEN35_MOE_VERIFY_WINDOW=0`` keeps it too.

MLX commits a command buffer once the inputs bound to it exceed its size cap
(50 MB by default), counting each input array whole. The stacked expert
weights are hundreds of MB, so every launch that binds them ends a command
buffer (~10-20 us of host CPU and a GPU gap per commit, and the host blocks
once too many are in flight). The kernels therefore bind a one-expert view
that shares the stacked array's buffer at offset 0 and index the other
experts from it. The weights are resident model parameters, so the cap has
nothing to bound here. Only scheduling changes;
``OMLX_QWEN35_MOE_ROUTED_DECODE_VIEWS=0`` binds the whole arrays.
